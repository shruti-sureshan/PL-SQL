# PL-SQL

PL/SQL is a combination of SQL along with the procedural features of programming languages. Pl/SQL stands for "Procedural Language extension of SQL". It was developed by Oracle Corporation. PL/SQL is a block structured language that can have multiple blocks in it. 

PL/SQL gives high productivity to programmers as it can query, transform, and update data in a database. PL/SQL saves time on design and debugging by strong features, such as exception handling, encapsulation, data hiding, and object-oriented data types.<br/>
This repository contains Lab Practicals which I have performed.



**List of Experiments:**<br/>
•	Finding the biggest number by directly assigning values to variables if then loop.<br/>
•	Program to get salary of an employee with a specific SSN and display it on the screen<br/>
•	Program to print numbers from 1 to 5 using simple loop<br/>
•	Program to find largest value of two numbers.<br/>
•	Program to show the effect of user defined exception<br/>
•	Program to show the effect of predefined exception<br/>
•	Implement implicit cursor for increasing the salary of employees to 15% of the basic pay.(Salary is the basic pay) for employees working in Computer and IT department. Display the number of affected records<br/>
•	Using Explicit cursor display the employee name and department of all employees whose Designation is Teaching.<br/>
•	Implement cursor with for loop which inputs employees name and displays the department name for employees belong in to computer Engineering and IT.<br/>
•	Write a Procedure which takes the inputs as numbers and operands and perform the basic mathematical operations<br/>
